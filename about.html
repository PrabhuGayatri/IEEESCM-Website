                IE-E&E is a student chapter of the Electrical and Electronics department of Manipal Institute of technology, aimed at developing more and more technical skills. 
                The club organises numerous events such as technical paper presentations, quizzes, guest lectures, industrial tours, publishes its own semi-annual newsletter and has an event of its own named 'Electrific' in Techtatva. 
                Our main objective is to promote technical awareness among engineering students and give them a platform where they can freely express their technical knowledge while learning at the same time. 
                To achieve our goal of excellence in the field of technology, we are trying our best to provide base for those zealous and hardworking students so that they can grow, nurture, and explore the opportunities.
